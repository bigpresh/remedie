Remedie is under development and requires lots of hacking

For now, run

  > rm -r ~/.remedie
  > perl -Ilib -MRemedie::DB::Schema -e 'Remedie::DB::Schema->install'

to initialize SQLite database.

Run

  > perl -Ilib ./bin/remedie-server.pl

and access http://localhost:10010/

You can type Ctrl-shift-r (Cmd-shift-r if you're on Mac) to refresh all feeds from UI, but you might
need to perioridically run the following command to update feeds automatically.

  > perl -Ilib ./bin/remedie-worker.pl

I hope this will eventually become standalone installable app using preferencePanes etc.
