Remedie is under development and requires lots of hacking

For now, run

  > perl -Ilib -MRemedie::DB::Schema -e 'Remedie::DB::Schema->install'

to initialize SQLite database. Remove ~/.remedie/remedie.db if needed to run it more than twice.

Run

  > perl -Ilib ./bin/remedie-server.pl

and access http://localhost:10010/

You need to perioridically run

  > perl -Ilib ./bin/remedie-worker.pl

to update the feeds.

I hope this will eventually become standalone installable app using preferencePanes etc.
