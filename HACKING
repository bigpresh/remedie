== INSTALL

Remedie is under development and requires lots of hacking

For now, run

  > rm -r ~/.remedie
  > perl -Ilib -MRemedie::DB::Schema -e 'Remedie::DB::Schema->install'

to initialize SQLite database. When we change the schema you might
need to do that again (and that will lose all your items in the
database!) until we come up with a decent schema upgrading system.

When you initialized the database, run

  > perl -Ilib ./bin/remedie-server.pl

and access http://localhost:10010/ to see the app running. The logs
and app cache are stored in ~/.remedie and ~/.plagger dirctory.

You can type Ctrl-shift-r (Cmd-shift-r if you're on Mac) to refresh all feeds from UI.

I hope this will eventually become standalone installable app using preferencePanes etc.

== DEBUGGING

Got a black screen or JavaScript alert "Can't load subscription"? Try:

  > env REMEDIE_DEBUG=1 perl -Ilib ./bin/remedie-server.pl

and see ~/.remedie/error.log for the errors. You can quick check the
perl module dependencies by running

  > ack -h ^use lib | sort -u | perl

and we have a plan to write a full Makefile.PL and probably bundle
required modules in extlib in the future.

== TODO

* Make the web server, jQuery interface and Plagger process asynchronous (non-blocking)
* Upgrade database schema to the standard database normalization
* Add HTTP authentication
* Add User and per channel preferences
