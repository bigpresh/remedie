This is Perl module Remedie.

INSTALLATION

Do not install Remeide (yet) but run the commands from svn checkout
directory.

Especially, if you have Plagger installed in your system, running
'make install' for Remedie breaks your existent Plagger installation
because we forked Plagger. So, don't do that.

DOCUMENTATION

Remedie documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc Remedie

to read the documentation online with your favorite pager.
